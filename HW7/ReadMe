Within this HW, I have worked with Allie DeAbreu, Victor Ramirez, Liam Kelley, and Shea Fitzgerald.
Personally I had completed up through the data wrangling and visualization portion without my group
but checked my answers with theirs. Additionally, I had completed the extra credit myself, but the group
used Shea Fitzgerald's answer to the problem. However from the 4th part of the homework, Shea Fitzgerald's
contributions were the majority of the progress that we had made. The 5th part of the homework was a 
group effort in order to explain why the null hypothesis was rejected and confirmed in certain areas of 
the data
For the second portion of the HW that was due Friday (10/25), Shea Fitzgerald and Liam Kelley 
completed the majority of the coding with input from the group as needed.
